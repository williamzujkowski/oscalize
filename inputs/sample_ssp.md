This is an example cloud-based software service that provides document management capabilities to federal agencies. The system is hosted on AWS infrastructure and follows FedRAMP security controls.

**System Boundaries:**
The system boundary includes:
- Web application frontend
- API gateway
- Database servers
- Load balancers
- Authentication services

**Security Categorization (FIPS-199):**

- **Integrity:** Moderate  
- **Availability:** Low

### Control Implementations

#### AC-1 Access Control Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
The organization has implemented comprehensive access control policies and procedures. All user access is managed through centrally managed identity providers with multi-factor authentication required for all administrative access.

**Responsible Role:** Security Team, System Administrator

**Assessment Procedures:**
- Review access control policies annually
- Test authentication mechanisms quarterly
- Audit user access logs monthly

#### AC-2 Account Management

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
User accounts are managed through automated provisioning systems. Account creation, modification, and deletion are logged and monitored. Privileged accounts require additional approval workflows.

**Responsible Role:** Identity Management Team

#### AU-1 Audit and Accountability Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Comprehensive audit logging is implemented across all system components. Logs are centrally collected, monitored, and retained for compliance requirements.

#### IA-2 Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users)

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
All users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Authentication integrates with organizational identity providers supporting SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

#### AT-1 Awareness and Training Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
The organization has established security awareness and training policies and procedures. All personnel receive annual security awareness training and role-based training for specialized positions.

#### CA-1 Security Assessment and Authorization Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Security assessment and authorization policies define the methodology for security controls assessment and system authorization. Continuous monitoring procedures ensure ongoing authorization compliance.

#### CM-1 Configuration Management Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Configuration management policies ensure secure baseline configurations are maintained. All configuration changes are documented, approved, and tested before deployment.

#### CP-1 Contingency Planning Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Contingency planning policies address system backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity. Regular testing ensures contingency procedures remain effective.

#### MA-1 System Maintenance Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
System maintenance policies define authorized maintenance activities and personnel. All maintenance is documented and performed with appropriate security precautions.

#### MP-1 Media Protection Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Media protection policies address digital and physical media handling, marking, storage, and disposal. All media containing sensitive information is properly protected throughout its lifecycle.

#### PE-1 Physical and Environmental Protection Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Physical and environmental protection policies define security controls for facilities, equipment rooms, and work areas. Environmental monitoring and access controls protect system components.

#### PL-1 Security Planning Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Security planning policies establish the framework for developing, implementing, and maintaining security plans. Regular reviews ensure plans remain current and effective.

#### PS-1 Personnel Security Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Personnel security policies define requirements for position risk designations, screening, and ongoing suitability. Background investigations are conducted commensurate with risk levels.

#### SA-1 System and Services Acquisition Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
System and services acquisition policies ensure security requirements are incorporated into procurement processes. Vendor security assessments and contract security terms protect organizational interests.

#### SI-1 System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
System and information integrity policies address flaw remediation, malicious code protection, and information system monitoring. Automated tools provide continuous integrity monitoring.

#### SR-1 Supply Chain Risk Management Policy and Procedures

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**Control Implementation:**
Supply chain risk management policies address risks from external service providers and system components. Vendor risk assessments and supply chain monitoring ensure secure sourcing practices.
